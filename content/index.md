Hello and welcome to my website! In case you made it here without knowing, I am Guilherme, an Applied Scientist at Amazon, and this website is my attempt at both a wikipedia for papers and a machine learning blog. 

As of January 2024, I am just starting to build this website and porting over my paper notes from Obsidian. You may find the links below helpful in the meantime:
- If you want to reach out regarding a work/research opportunity, then see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilunga/)
- If you want to see the code for this website, among other things, then see my [Github](https://github.com/GIlunga) (and check out [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)!)
- If you want to see my work in progress collection of ML papers and notes, then see the [[Papers]] page
- If for some reason you made it here and are interested in photography instead of machine learning, then see my [portfolio](https://gilunga.myportfolio.com/)
