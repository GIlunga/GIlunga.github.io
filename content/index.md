Welcome, I'm Gui, a machine learning scientist/engineer at Bumble and this is my website!
Here you will find **human-generated** paper summaries, research deep-dives, and maybe even personal project reports. You can find some of my recent posts on the side (or at the bottom if on mobile). Recently I have been interested in [[LLM|LLMs]], particularly post-training and [[RL]], and in [[recsys|recommender systems]], particularly sequential models and [[gen_retrieval|generative retrieval]].

If you find any issue or just want to say hi, then reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilunga/). Or, if besides machine learning you are also interested in photography, then see my [portfolio](https://gilunga.myportfolio.com/).
