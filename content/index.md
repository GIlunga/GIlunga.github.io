Hey! I'm Gui, a machine learning engineer. Currently I work at Bumble on their recommendation algorithm. I have previously worked at Amazon building purchase prediction / recommendation systems (see [whitepaper](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/AdProductsWebsite/images/Inside_the_predictive_AI_model_powering_Amazon_DSP_Performance_and_Brand.pdf), skip to page 12) and at Microsoft Research on several research projects (check out [this holographic storage devices paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3708993)).

Here you will find **human-generated** paper summaries, deep-dives, and project reports. You can find some of my recent posts on the side (or at the bottom if on mobile). Recently I have been interested in [[LLM|LLMs]], particularly post-training and [[RL]], and in [[recsys|recommender systems]], particularly sequential models and [[gen_retrieval|generative retrieval]].

If you find any issue or just want to say hi, then reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilunga/). Or, if besides machine learning you are also interested in photography, then see my [portfolio](https://gilunga.myportfolio.com/).
