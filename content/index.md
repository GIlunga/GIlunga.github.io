Hello and welcome to my website! In case you made it here without knowing, I am Guilherme, a Machine Learning Applied Scientist at Amazon, and this website is my attempt at both a *"wikipedia"* for papers and a machine learning blog. 

As of January 2025, I am still working on building this website and porting over my existing notes. You may find the below links helpful in the meantime:
- If you want to know more about me, see the  [[About]] page
- If you want to reach out to me, then see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilunga/)
- If you want to see the code for this website, then see my [Github](https://github.com/GIlunga) (and check out [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)!)
- If you want to see my work in progress collection of ML papers and notes, then see the papers section (or use the search function ). There is also a list of the most recent updated articles below
- If for some reason you made it here and are interested in photography instead of machine learning, then see my [portfolio](https://gilunga.myportfolio.com/)
