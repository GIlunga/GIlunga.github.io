- Paper year visible on the page itself
- add stubs for existing refs
- add missing concepts
- improve old paper formats
- add github links
- Authors should be searchable!! What about et.al. - maybe add them as properties? Ideally they could be a part of the graph too, so you could just find people and get all of their papers
