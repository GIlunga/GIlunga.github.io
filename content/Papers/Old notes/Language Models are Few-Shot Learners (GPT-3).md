> [!Abstract]  
> Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by ﬁne-tuning on a speciﬁc task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art ﬁnetuning approaches. Speciﬁcally, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations speciﬁed purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-ﬂy reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we ﬁnd that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this ﬁnding and of GPT-3 in general.
