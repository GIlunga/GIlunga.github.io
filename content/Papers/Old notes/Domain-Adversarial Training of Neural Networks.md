> [!Abstract]  
> We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in which data at training and test time come from similar but diﬀerent distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for eﬀective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains.
