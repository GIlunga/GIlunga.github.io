> [!Abstract]  
> This paper demonstrates that multilingual denoising pre-training produces signiﬁcant performance gains across a wide variety of machine translation (MT) tasks. We present mBART – a sequence-to-sequence denoising auto-encoder pre-trained on large-scale monolingual corpora in many languages using the BART objective (Lewis et al., 2019). mBART is the ﬁrst method for pre-training a complete sequence-to-sequence model by denoising full texts in multiple languages, while previous approaches have focused only on the encoder, decoder, or reconstructing parts of the text. Pre-training a complete model allows it to be directly ﬁne tuned for supervised (both sentence-level and document-level) and unsupervised machine translation, with no task-speciﬁc modiﬁcations. We demonstrate that adding mBART initialization produces performance gains in all but the highest-resource settings, including up to 12 BLEU points for low resource MT and over 5 BLEU points for many document-level and unsupervised models. We also show it also enables new types of transfer to language pairs with no bi-text or that were not in the pre-training corpus, and present extensive analysis of which factors contribute the most to effective pre-training.
