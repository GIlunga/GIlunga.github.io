Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a technique used to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks using labelled data. It involves taking a model that was pre-trained on large datasets and then further training it on a specialised labeled dataset to improve its performance for particular applications.

In the context of [[LLM | LLMs]], SFT is typically used as the first step in the alignment process, teaching them to follow instructions and respond appropriately to user queries.
